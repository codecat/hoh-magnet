# Magnet
Mod that adds a Magnet item to the game that pulls in pickups for you. You just have to be near the pickups.

The item is an uncommon item and normally costs 1200 gold. It can not yet be attuned. An idea is to let attunement increase the radius of the pickups in the future.

A video of this mod in action can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xneM1kFuW9w). You can find the mod on the Steam Workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1685656444).
